<h1>Chat control, the privacy nightmare that keeps coming back</h1>

    <p>I am a 13-year-old student from Slovenia. I care about privacy and my future as an EU citizen, and currently the
        future is looking bleak. Wars, even more wars, homelessness, late stage capitalism and
        privacy nightmares.</p>
    <h3>What is chat control?</h3>
    <p>Chat control is a method that the European Commission has proposed for monitoring online communication. This is
        the third time they have attempted to implement it. It
        involves
        requiring technology companies to scan all chat messages and report them. While it has not yet been implemented,
        there is currently a law in place that allows providers to scan your messages. This is optional, so they are not
        forced to do so. It is worth noting that only a few unencrypted communication providers currently engage in this
        type of scanning, including Skype, Snapchat, Gmail, Facebook and Instagram Messenger, iCloud email and Xbox.
        Even
        end-to-end encrypted messaging apps would not be excluded from chat control, which could potentially undermine
        the
        entire point of it. The EU Commission also plans to include mandatory age verification, which would make
        anonymity harder to achieve
    </p>
    <h3>How could (or will) chat control affect individuals?</h3>
    <p>Chat control would allow your chats to be scanned, which could lead to you being falsely reported, because
        according
        to Swiss federal police authorities 80% of automatically generated reports are false.</p>
    <p>A hacker could potentially spy on your conversations by using flaws in the way the government gathers
        conversations
        on chat apps and freedom of speech would not exist anymore on the internet, because all chats would be scanned
        and
        people would not be able to talk without constantly thinking if what they're saying would be permitted by the
        government. Without freedom of speech, democracy is <em>gone</em></p>
    <p>Chat control would, ironically, make illegal images or videos harder to track down. Criminals would be forced
        into using their own servers, which would be impossible to decrypt.</p>
    <p>For example, if you were to send nude images of yourself, they would not only arrive to the intended recipient,
        but
        also to someone else, who you don't know and can't trust with private information.</p>
    <p>Chat control would not affect criminals, <em>at all</em>. They would just use an illegal messaging service that
        doesn't do
        chat control, therefore the only group that would actually be affected would be non-criminals. Chat control
        would
        only make privacy online illegal and only harm those, who are not criminals. One example of this happening is
        when NSA employees shared nude pictures of people without consent.</p>
    <p>Secure communication protects groups, that are frequently attacked, such as activists, LGBTQ+, politicians and
        journalists. Without the protection of secure communication chat control could be abused to cause further damage
        to these minorities.</p>
    <h3>What <em>should</em> be done about illegal material?</h3>
    <li>Easily available call centers for support, so children can contact them without fear.</li>
    <li>Functionality in online services, such as chat apps, that allows users to report messages or other media.</li>
    <li>Education of kids about online safety, so that they can recognise online grooming and stop it.</li>
    <li>Instead of wasting police resources by checking machine generated reports, they should be tracking down
        illegal content on the dark web and taking it down.
    </li>
    <p>Finally, remember: privacy matters, to young people in EU and beyond</p>
